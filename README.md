## About

This project was created for recruitment purpose.

The component is in Autocomplete.tsx file, I also added two custom hooks, which you can find in /hooks folder.

You can pass any data to the component, just make sure it is a list of objects with properties `{title, id}`

Data is in books.json file in /public folder. 

In the project directory, you can run:
`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Improvements

To make better UX I could add keyboard navigation to make it 100% usable mouse-free.
